## v0.2.6
 * Updates the bundled file(1) version to 5.11.
 * Support for passing an array of paths with the callback getting an array of MIME types - [#3](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/mime-magic/pull/3).

## v0.2.5
 * The make.js wrapper outputs the whole process after file(1) installation.

## v0.2.4
 * Updates the bundled file(1) version to 5.10.
 * Windows support.

## v0.2.3
 * Merges the changes from [#1](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/mime-magic/pull/1): couldn't use fileWrapper more than once unless restarted server.

## v0.2.2
 * Updates the bundled file(1) version to 5.09.
 * Uses child_process.execFile() instead of child_process.exec(). Besides avoiding spawning a new shell, the current approach also avoids path escaping issues and command injections.

## v0.2.1
 * Updates the bundled file(1) version to 5.08. This version adds application/zip detection among others.
 * Updates the build tool to rebuild file(1) if the expected version is different than the installed version.

## v0.2
 * Includes the file(1) (v5.07) source tree along with a build script which was made to work on Ubuntu / OS X. The wrapper uses this file version along with the appropriate magic database.

## v0.1.1
 * Updated the error detection code. Some file 4.x/5.x versions used to send the error message via STDOUT. The recent versions fix this behavior by sending the error message via STDERR. mime-magic error reporting is compatible with both.

## v0.1
 * Initial release featuring a simple file(1) wrapper.
